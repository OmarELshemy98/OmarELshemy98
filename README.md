      * **API Testing Tools** (e.g., Postman, Insomnia for testing RESTful endpoints)
      * **Build Tools & Task Runners** (e.g., Webpack, Vite, Gulp fundamentals for automating development tasks)
      * **Web Storage** (LocalStorage & SessionStorage for client-side data persistence)
      * **Icon Libraries** (e.g., Font Awesome for scalable vector icons)
      * **Google Fonts** (for enhancing web typography)
